# BlackJackGame
Project Violet's Black Jack game project

To install our game and play it there are 2 ways. 

1. The easy and convinient way to download and play is to look to the right of the page and find the releases and click on Blackjack 1.0. Then from there all you have to do is click on the Blackjack.exe and it will install just like that. It should automatically go to your downloads folder and you can drag and drop it onto your desktop to easily click and play with convinience.

2. This second way allows you to edit the game if you wish but is less convinient to click and play. When your on the main Github page you can click the green <>code button and it will bring a menu that has an option to download zip. Once you click that it will download and all you have to do from there is extract the files by right-clicking on the folder and the option will appear. Then assuming you have a code editor like visual studio code, you can open the folder in the code editor and edit as you please. Running the gui.py file is what will boot up the game.

HEADS UP!
When you run the .exe file it will bring up a windows protection warning but all you have to do is click on more info and then press run anyway.

Also, there are 2 images that do not load on the .exe file but if you run the gui.py file it will load and you can then see them.
